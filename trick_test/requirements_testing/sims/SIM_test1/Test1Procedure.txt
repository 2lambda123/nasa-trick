TEST 1

PURPOSE: This test verifies the checkpoint-reload requirements specified
in section 3.1.2.9 of the Trick reuirements document.

REQUIREMENTS:
3.1.2.9, 3.1.2.9.1, 3.1.2.9.2, 3.1.2.9.3 ,3.1.2.9.4, 3.1.2.9.5

TEST STEPS:

1) Run CP.

    Expected result(s): CP completes successfully. You should see:

    === Simulation make complete ===

2) Type the following and press RETURN: 
   S_main_{$TRICK_HOST_CPU}.exe RUN_test/input

    Expected result(s):
            a) the sim_control panel appears,
            b) the sim is in Freeze mode and
            c) Run Elapsed Time (RET) is equal to 0.00.

3) Run the simulation for a few seconds by pressing the Start button
 on the sim_control panel, waiting about three seconds and then pressing the Freeze button.

    Expected result(s):
            a) the sim is again in freeze mode and
            b) RET is non-zero.

4) Record the value in the RET field. (e.g., 3.00) : _____

5) On the sim control panel Press the "Dump Chkpnt" button.
   Expected result(s):
            A file dialog appears. 

6) Record the name of checkpoint file. (e.g., chk_3.00) : _____ 

7) On the dialog, press the Save button.
   Expected result(s):
            a) The file dialog disappears. 
            b) an ASCII file of the name recorded in step 6 is created in the RUN_test/ directory. 

8) Run the simulation for a few more seconds by pressing the Start button
on the sim_control panel, waiting about three seconds and then pressing the Freeze button.

   Expected result(s):
            a) the sim is again in freeze mode and
            b) RET is greater than that recorded in step 4.

4) Record the value in the RET field. (e.g., 5.00) :  _____

9) On the sim control panel Press the "Load Chkpnt" button.

   Expected result(s):
          A file dialog appears.

10) In the "File name" field of the file dialog, enter the name of the
checkpoint file recorded in step 6 and press the Open button.

   Expected result(s):
          the value in the RET field returns to the value recorded in step 4.

11) Press Start.

   Expected result(s):
          The simulation runs to completion.

12) Press Exit.
   Expected result(s):
    Sim control panel disappears.
 
13) Verify that the ASCII file RUN_test/chkpnt_pre_init exists. 

14) Verify that the ASCII file RUN_test/chkpnt_post_init exists.

15) Verify that the ASCII file RUN_test/chkpnt_end_10.000 exists.

END OF TEST.
