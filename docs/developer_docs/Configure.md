# Updating the configure script

Trick uses `autoconf` to find and version check dependencies. The autoconf scripts live in the `autoconf/` directory, and the generated script that the user runs is `configure` in the Trick home directory.


## How to update the configure script

The configure script run by the user is generated by autoconf. To update it - 

1. Make changes in the `autoconf/` directory, likely to `configure.ac` and macros in the `m4/` directory
1. From the `autoconf/` directory, run:
```
aclocal
autoconf -o ../configure
```


### Notes

If you get an error message that looks like 

```
possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR
```

Install the package `autoconf-archive`.
