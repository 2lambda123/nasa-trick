**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Include a code snippet as appropriate, e.g.
```C++
#include <iostream>
void cool_idea() {
  Trick::Distance a = 1 * Trick::feet;    // Compile time conversion
  Trick::Distance b = 1 * Trick::meters;  // The superior unit system
  Trick::Distance c = a + b;              // Zero-cost abstraction
  std::cout << "a + b = " << c.as_inches() << std::endl;  // No more unit errors!
  // Should output "a + b = 15.6576 inches"
}
```
