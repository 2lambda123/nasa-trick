# New Years Eve Balldrop Simulation

The movement of the ball is controlled by the change in gravity. Imagine watching the new years ball drop in the gravitational field of the moon, mars, or even the sun.

## Building the Simulation

1. Build the simulation excecutable.
   
```bash
cd SIM_balldrop
```

```bash
trick-CP
```

3. Build the graphics client.
   
```bash
cd models/graphics
```

```bash
make
```

## Running the Simulation

1. Run the simulation .exe accoording the the input file.
   
```bash
cd ../../../SIM_balldrop
```

```bash
./S_main_*.exe RUN_test/input.py
```
